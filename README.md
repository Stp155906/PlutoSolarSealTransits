## PlutoTransit
PlutoTransit is a Java program designed to track and display the transit position of the planet Pluto through the zodiac constellations over time.

### Features
This program uses a two-dimensional array to store the predefined positions of Pluto in each zodiac constellation for each year, over defined 20-year periods. This array is then converted to a HashMap, providing efficient lookup for Pluto's position for any given year.
It allows users to input a desired year and zodiac sign, and then searches the transit data for the position of Pluto in that year.
Usage
The user will be prompted to enter:

A desired year
A desired zodiac sign
If the input year and zodiac are valid and exist in the predefined data, the position of Pluto for that year is printed. If not, an appropriate message will be displayed.

Limitations & Future Development
This program currently only includes data for a limited number of 20-year periods and does not handle cases where the desired year or zodiac sign is not found in the transit data. Future development will aim to expand the data set and include error handling for these cases.

Contribution
Contributions are welcomed to enhance the features and make it more user-friendly, extend the transit data, and implement error handling.
